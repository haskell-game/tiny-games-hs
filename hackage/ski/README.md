## Play

Get ready to ski! `a` and `d` move left and right.\
Avoid the ðŸŒ² trees! ðŸŒ² How long can you last ?

Best played in a white background terminal.

Uses emojis, may not look right or run well with all fonts/terminal apps.
Mac users: it is unplayably slow in Terminal or iTerm 3.4 -
use iTerm 3.5 beta or newer, or eg VS Code's terminal, instead.

## About

This is a classic - one of the simplest ways to build a fast action game
that could always be expected to run reasonably well,
since one thing every machine can do well is scroll text upwards... right ?

Relying on print (putStrLn) means the player is always at the bottom of the
screen, with no forward visibility. But this could be quite realistic. :)

For a more elaborate version, with replayable levels, persistent high scores
and sound effects, try [caverunner](https://github.com/simonmichael/games/tree/main/caverunner).
