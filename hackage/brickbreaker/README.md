Move the pointer to move the paddle.
The ball is lost if it moves past the paddle.
Try to destroy all bricks!

Tip: the bottom of the ball has magical destructive properties, try to get it
above the bricks to destroy many at once.

Adjust the `r` variable if the game is too big or too small for your screen
