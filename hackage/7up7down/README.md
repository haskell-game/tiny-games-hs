# 7up7down

A terminal based guessing game. The player has to guess the result of rolling
two dice as 7up, 7down or 7.

## Runnnig

Only tested on linux: Execute `7up7down.hs` while `stack` available in
`$PATH`. It _should_ just work on other Operating Systems ðŸ¤ž

## Notes

This game requires a random number generator, since Haskell2010 the `random`
package is not part of default packages, so this game needs to in the
`hackage-10-80` category. The game only uses 8 lines (without using
`Imports.hs`), so an improvement idea is to implement dice rolling by reading
`/dev/urandom` and be part of `base-10-80` category, but this will definitely
not work on Windows, so perhaps it is not worth it.

Another idea for improvement could be to make the game validate player input so
the player doesn't automatically lose by making typos.

When using `stack script` with `--compile`, the buffering mode is set to
`LineBuffering`, this causes the input prompt to not get flushed and it seems
like the game is just stuck. Smallest way to get around it was to use `hFlush
stdout`. Curiously this doesn't happen without the `--compile` flag, but that
causes the game to take too long to start.

Writing something like `if i=="7"then b+2else b+1` is valid haskell even if
there is no space between `2` and `else`. However, it is even shorter to write
`b+1+fromEnum(i=="7")`. Using `fromEnum` also helps GHC infer type of b to be
`Int`, so this also gets rid of a type annotation.

If the terminal is using a nerd fonts patched font, replacing `9855` with
`983498` will produce nicer looking dice. Including this in the game code would
of course go against having it "just work", so it was left out.

    else
      putStr

        )
        >> hFlush stdout
        >> getLine
        >>= \i ->
          if i /= "q"
            then
              (,) <$> randomRIO (1, 6) <*> randomRIO (1, 6) >>= \(x, y) ->

                  $ if (x + y > 7 && i == "7up") || (x + y < 7 && i == "7down") || (x + y == 7 && i == "7")
                    then
                      ( "You win!",
                        b + 1 + fromEnum (i == "7")
                      )
                    else ("You lose!", (b - 1))
            else putStrLn "Bye!"

--  Guess the result of rolling two 6 sided dice by writing one of 7up, 7down or
--  7.
--  7up wins if the result greater than 7
--  7down wins if the result is less than 7
--  7 wins if the result is exactly 7.
--  Starting balance is â‚¹10, every bet is â‚¹1.
--  On victory with 7up or 7down, the player wins â‚¹1
--  On victory with a 7, the player wins â‚¹2.
--  Enter q instead of a guess to exit.
--  Any invalid inputs (including typos) lose.
