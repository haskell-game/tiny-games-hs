# Haskell Tiny Game Jam

Inspired by the [BASIC 10Liner contest](https://www.homeputerium.de) (see their english rules at the bottom):
the first Haskell tiny games contest runs through February 2023!
The prize.. glory! <!-- and advancing the Haskell game dev craft -->

Submit your entries now (as many as you like) to this repo
(send a pull request, or push if you have access),
or paste in the #haskell-game chat ([Matrix] or [IRC]) and we'll commit for you.
sm and f-a are your judges, informed by #haskell-game.

## Rules

Here are the general rules for this round:

1. Make a playable game in one haskell file of up to 10 lines of up to 80 characters each.
2. This can be a [runghc], [stack] or [cabal] script, or a small haskell program, but not a multi-file project.
   Some templates are provided to give ideas.
   Our ideal is a self-contained 10 line program that just works, like BASIC programs.
3. Unlimited comments and notes are permitted after line 11.
   The game's "category/name (author)" info should appear here,
   and brief essential info like player controls (in case someone sees just this file,
   eg in chat).
4. The script or program must either be executable and run reliably (eg like a stack script),
   or it must contain reliable build instructions (eg a ghc command line with all needed package options).
   Entries which aren't straightforward to run are incomplete.
   Achieving programs that "just work" is a core principle and part of the challenge.
   Tips:
   - env -S in the shebang line doesn't work on older GNU/Linux systems.
     If you use it, also show a reliable run command in the comments, to be used in
     in the play script. (See https://github.com/haskell-game/tiny-games-hs/issues/25.)
   - Avoid requiring problematic GHC versions. In particular GHC <9.2 doesn't work well on mac.
     If you specify a GHC version/stackage snapshot, the current release is ideal (GHC 9.2, lts-20).
5. The game should run on all major platforms, ideally.
6. The game must be accompanied by a small square screenshot, ideally static and non-gif.
   (Not animated, because Github's player overlay will obscure it. 
   Not a gif, because you can't make those clickable on Github it seems.)
7. A separate README file is optional, but can add value,
   such as animations, or discussion of the game/code/experience.
   Website visitors will see this on clicking your game.
8. You're welcome to include a less-minified version of the code, that people can learn from.
9. Contest entries will be collected in this repo.
10. You can submit any number of entries, in the following categories:

   **`prelude-10-80`**
   : No imports may be used. ([template1](prelude/template1.hs))

   **`base-10-80`**
   : Imports from the base package may be used. ([template1](base/template1.hs))

   **`default-10-80`**
   : Packages installed by default with GHC may be used.
     Also a second file named Import.hs may be used to gather and re-export imports, only.
    ([template1](default/template1.hs))

   **`hackage-10-80`**
   : All packages on Hackage may be used, and an Import.hs file may be used. ([template1](hackage/template1.hs))

## Let's play!

You will need a suitable version of GHC (9.2.5+ or 9.4.4+ recommended), and stack (or cabal).
See <https://www.haskell.org/get-started/>.
Once Haskell is installed, and if you have bash, you can run `./play` in this repo:
```
~/src/tiny-games-hs$ ./play
--------------------------------------------------------
                 ___         __                          
|__| _  _|  _||   | . _     / _  _  _  _    | _  _    /| 
|  |(_|_)|((-||   | || )\/  \__)(_||||(-  __)(_||||    | 

--------------------------------------------------------
Here are the entries from HTGJ1, Feb 2023 !
This script can run each game for you, using ghc or stack
(if you don't have these yet, see https://www.haskell.org/get-started).
Usage: play [NUM|NAME|SUBSTR]

 1) guess1                [prelude]
 2) pure-doors            [prelude]
 3) fifteen               [prelude]
 4) chess                 [prelude]
...
```
or:
```
$ alias p=~/src/tiny-games-hs/play
$ p chess
$ p 4
```

If you don't have bash, cd into each game's directory and try running the game's .hs file.
If that fails, look for run/build instructions in that file or a nearby readme.

## Development Tools

### Minifier

Since  haskell-game/tiny-games-hs#14, we have a [minifier](minify.hs) that can turn your game into a brick of inscrutable code no more than 80 characters wide, provided that you add curled braces and semicolons over all your program, so that it becomes white space insensitive.â€‚@kindaro is the owner of the minifier, ping him with your reviews and suggestions.
