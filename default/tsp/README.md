# TSP - Tiny Space Program

You are a rocket pilot flying for the Tiny Space Agency (TSA).
Your goal is to deliver curry to the Tiny Space Station (TSS).
There is no time to loose, you need to go as fast as possible.
The world record, by Simon Kerman Jones, is under 9.9 seconds.

## Playing

Instructions:

- The game starts with your ship `>` attached to the launch pad clamp `--,`.
- Press <kbd>f</kbd> to fire the engine at full throttle.
- After a 3 seconds countdown, the ship is released and you lift off.
- Release <kbd>f</kbd> when you have enough speed to reach the TSS `~|~`.
- After you reach the station you need to go back and land on the launch pad.
- Your ship is equiped with retrograde thrusters that you can activate with <kbd>r</kbd>.
- On your way down, reduce your vertical velocity by pressing <kbd>f</kbd> again.
- To survive the landing, your velocity must be over `-50`.
- When the delivery trip is completed, your travel time*10 is printed.
- Good luck!

This game implements a render loop using the bytestring `hGetNonBlocking` and `hPut`.
