{- gam-10-80-hs-prelude/pure-doors (tristanC)

The goal of pure-doors is to pass through doors by moving the player
left/forward/right with 'j'/'k'/'l'.


This game is powered by `interact :: (String -> String) -> IO ()`.
The trick is that the input/output are consumed/produced lazily.

For example:

>>> interact (\input -> "World\n" <> "Prompt: " <> take 1 input <> "Done\n")
World
Prompt: <player input>
Done

As you can see, `interact` produces the output until the input is needed lazily.
Therefore, the whole game is a pure `String -> String` function, hence its name.


This game's loop goes like this:

- L8, clear the screen.
- L5-7, draw the world.
- L9, if the state is valid, read the input and repeat.
- L10, otherwise, print the final score.

Here are the game components:

- The world is a list of doors tuple: (distance to player, door position).
  L4, The positions `nums` are generated using a `zipWith` fib sequence.
- The step function `s` takes a continuation argument to compute the next world:
    s :: Line -> Door -> Player -> Doors -> (\Doors -> String) -> String
  L5, when passing a door, check the player position.
  L6, after 5 lines, draw the player.
  L7, otherwise draw the current door or an empty line.
- The loop function `go` calls `s` and advances the game:
    go :: Score -> Doors -> Player -> String -> String
  L9, if the new world `m` is not empty and the input is valid, then recurse.
  L10, otherwise print the final score.
- The input char `c` is converted to a number using the Enum Char instance.


Note that the 9th door is impossible to pass, but there is a hidden trick:
use 'i' and 'm' to move the player by two :-)

Thanks for your time, have fun!
