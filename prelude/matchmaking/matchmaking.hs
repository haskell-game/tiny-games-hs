In a small Hungarian village there are several guys: Adám, Béla, Csaba, Dávid,
Erik, Feri, Géza, Imre, and Jenő — and several girls: Hanna, Kiara, Lujza, Maja,
Nóra, Petra, Róza, and Sára. Some of them like each other. Help each girl find
herself a husband — it must be someone she likes, and who likes her.

What you see is a table with the names of all the guys and girls (girls names
are written vertically), where `.` means this guy would not make a suitable
husband for this girl, and `O` means he is a good choice. Enter first letters of
his and her names, without spaces, in that order, like `AH` — meaning, Adám gets
to marry Hanna. If Adám is not a good match for Hanna, entering `AH` will
produce no effect and you'd have to try again. As you keep doing that, the
entries in the rows and columns you indicated would be replaced by `X` — showing
that those guys and girls aren't available anymore. You win if every girl finds
a husband; you lose if there are no other matches to make.

The game would start again after you finish it, with different possible couples.
Rest assured, there is a solution for each puzzle.
