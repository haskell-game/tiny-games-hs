In a small Hungarian village there are several guys: Adám, Béla, Csaba, Dávid, Erik, Feri, Géza, Imre, and Jenő — and several girls: Hanna, Kiara, Lujza, Maja, Nóra, Petra, Róza, and Sára. Some of them like each other. Help each girl find herself a husband — it must be someone she likes, and who likes her.

What you see is a table with the names of all the guys and girls (girls names are written vertically), where `.` means this guy would not make a suitable husband for this girl, and `O` means he is a good choice. Enter first letters of his and her names, without spaces, in that order, like `AH` — meaning, Adám gets to marry Hanna. As you keep doing that, the entries in the rows and columns you indicated would be replaced by `X` — showing that those guys and girls aren't available anymore. You win if every girl finds a husband; you lose if there are no other matches to make.

The game would start again after you finish it, with different possible couples. Rest assured, there is a solution for each puzzle.

Note: the system depends on the `env` program supporting the `-S` switch — which should work in MacOS, any modern Linux, and MacOS.
