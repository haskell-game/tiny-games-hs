# A simple front end to run all games easily.
# XXX has to be updated as games are added/moved
# XXX most games exit back to the menu, some do not
# XXX a haskell port is welcome, maybe best for portability and power

# All games in category then submission order, same as in README.
# When updating this also update the select items below,
# eg move all non-standard invocations to their new locations.

Here are the entries from HTGJ1, Feb 2023 !
This script can run each game for you, using ghc or stack
(if you don't have these yet, see https://www.haskell.org/get-started).
Most games will return here on exit (others will require CTRL-c).
